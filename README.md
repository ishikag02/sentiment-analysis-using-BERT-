# Sentiment-analysis-using-BERT-
This is a sentiment analysis by using Hugging Face Transformers and BERT to be able to calculate sentiment. We'll run the model using a single prompt but also leverage BeautifulSoup to scrape reviews from Yelp to be able to calculate sentiment on a larger scale. 

The steps used are: 
1. Install Transformers
2. Perform Sentiment Scoring using BERT and Python
3. Scrape reviews from Yelp and Calculate their Sentiment
